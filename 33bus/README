The "data" repository includes all the raw RES and load data needed for the 33-bus test case.

In the test case used in the manuscript, the following modifications on the data have been made:

1. The forecast wind power(at bus 17, 24 and 32) has been multiplied by 1.5. They do not have reactive power capacities.
2. The forecast PV power (at other buses) has been multiplied by 0.35. They are implemented with inverters, whose capacities are 130% of the maximum upper bound of predicted generation ceiling of the day
3. The "load.xlsx" only gives the shape of the 96-section load curves. One can reshape the data for case study.

The definition of the system and the MGTs are in 33bus.py
The active power output lies between LB and UB.
The reactive power output lies between 0 and 0.1LB
